Thanks for considering Miro for your project! What&#39;s unique about our challenge is that we are previewing the as-yet-unreleased v2 of the Miro Platform. This means that you&#39;ll have access to new documentation and endpoints, and you&#39;ll be among the first to build an integration for the v2.
